/**
 * The ONE authoritative pin on the shape of the migration chain in
 * `backend/src/db/migrate.ts`.
 *
 * Before this file existed, 24 sibling `migration-vNN.test.ts` files each carried their
 * own copy of the same whole-chain assertions (strictly ascending, `versions[last] === 75`,
 * absolute `versionInserts()` tail arrays) over their own naive parse of the source.
 * Appending a migration therefore meant editing ~20 files - which is exactly why
 * migrations got appended without the tail pins being updated, and why that staleness
 * turned into a red suite once the folded pending SQL landed.
 *
 * The per-migration files keep what is per-migration (this migration's SQL, its markers,
 * its runner behaviour, its `_vNN` name). The whole-chain invariants live here, once.
 *
 * Adding a migration = append one entry to the `migrations` array in migrate.ts and run
 * `node scripts/gen-migration-versions.mjs`. Nothing else in the suite needs to move: the
 * expected version used by the health check is read from that generated manifest, not from a
 * second hand-maintained number, and the drift guard below fails if the manifest and migrate.ts
 * disagree.
 */

/**
 * The highest registered migration version. Imported, not restated: it used to be a literal
 * `75` here and a different literal in routes/security.ts (31) and a third in
 * migration-selfcheck.service.ts (58) — three "expected schema version" constants that all
 * disagreed while every one of them reported a green check.
